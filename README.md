~~~~

> [docker-compose.xml](https://github.com/blacklabelops/jenkins/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) contains a full list of environment variables.

Scaling jenkins slaves:

~~~~
$ docker-compose scale slave=3
~~~~

> Starts three java JDK-8 slaves.

## Features

Container has the following features:

* Install latest Jenkins.
* Enable security, install plugins, set swarm port with docker envs.
* On-Demand https.
* Set the Jenkins version number.
* Container writes data to Docker volume.
* Scripts for backup of Jenkins data.
* Scripts for restore of Jenkins data.
* Supports the Docker-Compose tool.
* Includes several convenient cli wrapper scripts around docker.

## What's Included

* Jenkins Latest
* CentOS 7.1.1503
* Java 8

## Works with

* Docker 1.6.0, 1.6.2
* Docker-Compose 1.2.0, 1.3.0

## Configuration

### Jenkins HTTPS

This container can create ad-hoc self-signed certificates for https without any reverse proxy. This
gives some out of the box network security. Note that reverse proxies and proper certificate work flows are always
to be prefered! I will use this until the Google Cloud Engine https load balancer will work.

At startup the container will create a unique self-signed certificate. This certificat will live as long as the docker volume. You have to pass Distinguished Name (DN) and a keystore password. The certificate is generated by a Distinguished Name and secured by the keystore password. This is a DN-Example:

~~~~
CN=SBleul,OU=Blacklabelops,O=blacklabelops.net,L=Munich,S=Bavaria,C=DE
~~~~

  * CN = Your name
  * OU = Your organizational unit.
  * O = Organisation name.
  * L = Location, e.g. town name.
  * S = State
  * C = Locale of your county.

Now start your container with additional parameters for starting jenkins with https and a keystore password.

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
	-e "JENKINS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=swordfish" \
	-e "JENKINS_CERTIFICATE_DNAME=CN=SBleul,OU=Blacklabelops,O=blacklabelops.net,L=Munich,S=Bavaria,C=DE" \
	-p 443:8080 \
	blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> Congratulations! You can now access your jenkins instance with simply typing https://youinstance.com! Accept the certificate inside your browser and have fun!

### Jenkins Security

This container support matrix enabled user security and admin account at startup. Jenkins
will be locked up and only allows the defined admin user. Afterwards users and rights
can be configured as usual. The admin password can be changed any time. I use this for starting
the container up inside cloud environments.

~~~~
$ docker run -d --name jenkins \
	-e "JENKINS_ADMIN_USER=jenkins" \
	-e "JENKINS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=swordfish"  \
	-p 8090:8080 \
	blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

### Jenkins Installing Plugins

Finally got this working:

You can define a set of plugins that will be installed, if necessary, during initialization. Very good
for testing out new plugins. Also adding default plugins like swarm. You have to define a list
of plugin-ids seperated by a whitespace.

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
  -e "JENKINS_PLUGINS=gitlab-plugin hipchat swarm" \
  -p 8090:8080 \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> This will install the plugins gitlab-plugin hipchat swarm once during post-inistialization.

### Jenkins Master Number of Executors

Jenkins jobs should be executed on slaves therefore it's good to be able to limit
the executors on the master.

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
  -e "JENKINS_MASTER_EXECUTORS=0" \
  -p 8090:8080 \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

### Jenkins Administrator Address

Setting the Administrators EMail Address. Has the form:
"Administrator Name <mail@example.com>"

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
  -e "JENKINS_ADMIN_EMAIL=Blacklabelops <blacklabelops@itbleul.de>" \
  -p 8090:8080 \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

### Jenkins Mail SMTP

The following parameters enable the servers mail settings.

Minimum example:

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
  -e "SMTP_USER_NAME=jenkins" \
  -e "SMTP_USER_PASS=swordfish" \
  -e "SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailservice.com" \
  -e "SMTP_PORT=2525" \
  -p 8090:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

Full example:

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
  -e "SMTP_USER_NAME=jenkins" \
  -e "SMTP_USER_PASS=swordfish" \
  -e "SMTP_HOST=smtp.mailservice.com" \
  -e "SMTP_PORT=2525" \
  -e "SMTP_REPLYTO_ADDRESS=dummy@example.com" \
  -e "SMTP_USE_SSL=true" \
  -e "SMTP_CHARSET=UTF-8" \
  -p 8090:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

### Jenkins Slave Port

The slave port enables the automatic connection of jenkins slaves. The port can be configured as follows.

~~~~
$ docker run --name jenkins \
  -e "JENKINS_SLAVEPORT=50000" \
  -p 8090:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> Slaves can connect on port 50000.

### Jenkins Command Line Parameters

You can define command line parameters. The list of parameters can be found [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Starting+and+Accessing+Jenkins).

~~~~
docker run -d --name jenkins \
	-e "JENKINS_PARAMETERS=--httpPort=8090" \
	-p 8090:8090 \
	blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> Starts Jenkins with internal port 8090 rather default port 8080.

### Java-VM Parameters

You can define start up parameters for the Java Virtual Machine, e.g. setting the memory size.

~~~~
docker run -d --name jenkins \
	-e "JAVA_VM_PARAMETERS=-Xmx512m -Xms256m" \
	-p 8090:8080 \
	blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> You will have to use Java 8 parameters.

### Jenkins Logging

This container does not write a logfile by default. It's considered bad practise as logs
should be accessed by the command `docker logs`. There are use case where you want to
have additional log files, e.g. my use case is to relay log to Loggly [Loggly Homepage](https://www.loggly.com/).
I have added a routine for logging and it's activated by defining a logfile.

Environment Variable: LOG_FILE

Example for a separate volume with a logfile:

~~~~
$ docker run -d -p 8090:8080 \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/jenkinslogs \
  -e "LOG_FILE=/jenkinslogs/jenkins.log" \
  --name jenkins \
  blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

> You can watch the log by typing `cat ./logs/jenkins.log`.

Now lets hook up the container with my Loggly side-car container and relay the log to Loggly! The Full
documentation of the loggly container can be found here: [blacklabelops/loggly](https://github.com/blacklabelops/fluentd/tree/master/fluentd-loggly)

~~~~
$ docker run -d \
  --volumes-from jenkins \
  -e "LOGS_DIRECTORIES=/jenkinslogs" \
	-e "LOGGLY_TOKEN=3ere-23kkke-23j3oj-mmkme-343" \
  -e "LOGGLY_TAG=jenkinslog" \
  --name jenkinsloggly \
  blacklabelops/loggly
~~~~

> Note: You need a valid Loggly Customer Key in order to log to Loggly.

### Jenkins Backups with rsnapshot

You can create automatic backups using [blacklabelops/rsnapshotd](https://github.com/blacklabelops/rsnapshot/tree/master/rsnapshot-cron).
This side-car container uses rsnapshot to create snapshots of your jenkins volume periodically.

Full documentation can be found here:  [blacklabelops/rsnapshotd](https://github.com/blacklabelops/rsnapshot/tree/master/rsnapshot-cron)

First fire up the Jenkins master:

~~~~
$ docker run -d -p 8090:8080 --name jenkins blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

Then start and attach the side-car backup container:

~~~~
$ docker run -d \
  --volumes-from jenkins \
	-v $(pwd)/snapshots/:/snapshots \
  -e "CRON_HOURLY=* * * * *" \
	-e "BACKUP_DIRECTORIES=/jenkins/ jenkins/" \
	blacklabelops/rsnapshotd
~~~~

> Mounts all volumes from the running container and snapshots the volume /jenkins inside the local
snapshot directory under `jenkins/`. Note: If you use Windows then you will have to replace $(pwd)
with an abolute path.

### Jenkins Backups in Google Storage Buckets

You can periodically create backups and upload them to your [Google Storage Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/).

Full documentation of the backup container can be found hee: [blacklabelops/gcloud](https://github.com/blacklabelops/gcloud)

First fire up the Jenkins master:

~~~~
$ docker run -d -p 8090:8080 --name jenkins blacklabelops/jenkins
~~~~

Then start and attach the [blacklabelops/gcloud](https://github.com/blacklabelops/gcloud) container!

The required example crontab can be found here: [example-crontab-backup.txt](https://github.com/blacklabelops/gcloud/blob/master/example-crontab-backup.txt)

~~~~
$ docker run \
  --volumes-from jenkins \
  -v $(pwd)/backups/:/backups \
  -v $(pwd)/logs/:/logs \
  -e "GCLOUD_ACCOUNT=$(base64 auth.json)" \
  -e "GCLOUD_CRON=$(base64 example-crontab-backup.txt)" \
  blacklabelops/gcloud
~~~~

> Uses the authentication file auth.json and executed the crontab th°°at uploads archives to the specified cloud bucket. Logs and
backups are available locally.


## Vagrant

Vagrant is fabulous tool for pulling and spinning up virtual machines like docker with containers. I can configure my development and test environment and simply pull it online. And so can you! Install Vagrant and Virtualbox and spin it up. Change into the project folder and build the project on the spot!

~~~~
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd /vagrant
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ docker-compose up
~~~~

> Jenkins will be available on localhost:9200 on the host machine.

Vagrant does not leave any docker artifacts on your beloved desktop and the vagrant image can simply be destroyed and repulled if anything goes wrong. Test my project to your heart's content!

First install:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
